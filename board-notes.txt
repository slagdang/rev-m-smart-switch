Round holes in center floods are for steel bus bars that go from those holes to the
wall side of the device to create neutral and line prongs. These are bent so as
to redirect the bars to line up with prong locations. Oval holes are for simple
steel bent metal socket conductors which create the socket on the non-wall side of
the device. The ground pin and socket are a single metal conductor which conducts
directly from the socket side to the prongs side of the device without any internal
electrical connection.
